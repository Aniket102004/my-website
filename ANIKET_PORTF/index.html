        <h1>Meet My Bestfriend Anuja</h1>
        <div class="introduction">
            <p>Anuja and I have been friends for over 12 years. She affectionately calls us "4lifers," and she's always been there for me during the toughest times. We've shared countless memories, from waiting for each other after school to going on cycle rides together. Whether it was sharing a Frankie or just hanging out, we've experienced so much together. Our friendship has seen us through ups and downs, and I wouldn't trade those moments for anything. She’s not just a friend; she’s family.</p>
